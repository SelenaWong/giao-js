### What is an Interpreter?

An interpreter is a language evaluator that runs in runtime executing the programâ€™s source on the fly. It is different from a compiler. Compilers translate a language source code to machine code.
An interpreter parses the source code, generates an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) from the source, iterates through the ASTs and evaluates them one after the other.

An interpreter has three stages:

Tokenization
Parsing
Evaluating
